Additionally, the\\nintegration of graph structures with vector representations facilitates\\nefficient retrieval of related entities and their relationships, significantly\\nimproving response times while maintaining contextual relevance. This\\ncapability is further enhanced by an incremental update algorithm that ensures\\nthe timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remain effective and\\nresponsive in rapidly changing data environments.

This approach aims to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. LightRAG addresses limitations in existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, such as reliance on flat data representations and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to fragmented answers. It incorporates graph structures into text indexing and retrieval processes, employing a dual-level retrieval system for comprehensive information retrieval. This system improves response times and maintains contextual relevance by efficiently retrieving related entities and their relationships. LightRAG also features an incremental update algorithm for timely integration of new data, ensuring effectiveness in rapidly changing environments. The paper reports significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency, and the LightRAG system is available as open-source at the provided GitHub link.\n"

Solving these\\nproblems ranges from being highly desirable requirements -- e.g. for\\ndelineation, which may be useful to disambiguate between similar types of\\nlesions, and perform improved diagnostics -- or required, as is the case for AI\\nde-biasing, to allow for the deployment of fair AI techniques in the clinic for\\nskin lesion analysis. For the problem of low shot learning in particular, we\\nreport skin analysis algorithms that gracefully degrade and still perform well\\nat low shots, when compared to baseline algorithms: when using a little as 10\\ntraining exemplars per class, the baseline DL algorithm performance\\nsignificantly degrades, with accuracy of 56.41%, close to chance, whereas the\\nbest performing low shot algorithm yields an accuracy of 85.26%.\"}\n",
